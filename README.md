# [![Collectable.js: Immutable Data Structures](https://github.com/frptools/collectable/raw/master/.assets/logo.png)](https://github.com/frptools/collectable)

An all-you-can-eat buffet of high-performance, [persistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure), [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object), [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) data structures. Collect them all!

> _Note: This library is an active **work in progress**. Some of the features and structures mentioned below are currently in progress, pending development, only partially-available, or flagged for cleanup/refactoring, prior to the first full 1.0 release. See the [project board](https://github.com/frptools/collectable/projects) for information on current development status. That all said, the library is very much usable, even at this early stage._

## Features

- A robust suite of **high-performance data structures** for most use cases
- Full **ES2015 module support** so that your application bundle only need grow in size according to what you actually use
- **Functional API**, prioritising an order of parameters best suited for currying and composition
- API for **deep operations** on **nested structures**
- Deep and shallow **conversion to and from native types**, including arrays, objects, iterables, Maps and Sets
- Complete set of **TypeScript definitions**
- Extensive **documentation** and **examples**
- **One package import** to access everything, **or isolated npm packages** for each individual data structure
- Comprehensive unit test suite, consisting of hundreds of tests for every data structure
- Strong focus on a code style that **emphasises high performance** internally

## Data Structures

- [ **[List](/packages/list#collectablejs-immutable-list)** ] A persistent [list/vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)) structure based on a modified [RRB Tree](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/169879/files/RMTrees.pdf) implementation.
- [ **[Map](/packages/map#collectablejs-immutable-map)** ] A persistent [hash map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array), mapping keys to values. Implemented as a Clojure-style [hash array mapped trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie).
- [ **[Sorted Map](/packages/sorted-map#collectablejs-immutable-sorted-map)** ] A persistent sorted [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) backed by a [red-black tree](/packages/red-black-tree#collectablejs-immutable-sorted-set) and a [hash map](/packages/map#collectablejs-immutable-map) with user-definable sort order.
- [ **[Set](/packages/set#collectablejs-immutable-set)** ] A persistent [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)), backed by a [hash map](/packages/map#collectablejs-immutable-map).
- [ **[Sorted Set](/packages/sorted-set#collectablejs-immutable-sorted-set)** ] A persistent sorted [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)) backed by a [red-black tree](/packages/red-black-tree#collectablejs-immutable-red-black-tree) and a [hash map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array), with user-definable sort order.
- [ **[Red Black Tree](/packages/red-black-tree#collectablejs-immutable-red-black-tree)** ] A persistent [red-black tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree), providing a balanced binary search tree which maps keys to values.

See the [road map](https://github.com/frptools/collectable/wiki) for information on further development and plans for additional features and data structures.

## Installation

```bash
# via NPM
npm install --save collectable

# or Yarn
yarn add collectable
```

TypeScript type definitions are included by default.

## Usage

**API Reference:**
[ [General](/docs/index.md#collectablejs-general-api)
| [List](/packages/list#collectablejs-immutable-list)
| [Map](/packages/map#collectablejs-immutable-map)
| [Sorted Map](/packages/sorted-map#collectablejs-immutable-sorted-map)
| [Set](/packages/set#collectablejs-immutable-set)
| [Sorted Set](/packages/sorted-set#collectablejs-immutable-sorted-set)
| [Red Black Tree](/packages/red-black-tree#collectablejs-immutable-red-black-tree)
| [Others...](https://github.com/frptools/collectable/wiki) ]

Individual data structures are pulled in automatically as dependencies of the main package. By having your project take a dependency on `collectable` itself, all data structures are made available implicitly as scoped imports, and operations on deeply-nested data structures are available via the main package.

For example, to use an immutable list:

```js
import {fromArray, unwrap} from '@collectable/list';

const list = fromArray(['X', 'Y']);
const array = unwrap(list);
```

To combine multiple data structures effectively, import [universal methods](/docs/index.md) from the main package and collection-specific methods from other relevant packages as needed:

```js
import * as C from 'collectable';
import * as List from '@collectable/list';
import {curry2} from '@typed/list';

const input = {
  foo: 'abc',
  xyz: [3, [5, 6], 7, 9]
};
const map0 = C.from(input); // <{foo: 'abc', xyz: <[3, [5, 6], 7, 9]>}>
const map1 = C.updateIn(['xyz', 1, 0], n => 4, map0); // <{foo: 'abc', xyz: <[3, [4, 6], 7, 9]>}>
const map2 = C.setIn(['foo', 'bar'], 'baz', map1); // <{foo: <{bar: 'baz'}>, xyz: ...>
const map3 = C.updateIn(['xyz', 1], curry2(List.append)(42)); // <{..., xyz: <[3, [5, 6, 42], 7, 9]>}>
```

Use a modern bundler such as Webpack 2 or Rollup in order to take advantage of tree shaking capabilities, giving you maximum flexbility to take the whole package as a dependency while excluding anything you don't use from the final build.
